## What is it?

Badges API enables users to create badges on their website or Wix App and assign them to site members.
Badges assigned to specific site members help them stand out from all the other members. 
Badges can have special permissions to access specific members-only pages (using roles). 
Site members will receive relevant permissions once assigned such badge.
