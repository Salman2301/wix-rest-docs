# Introduction

Activity Counters service allows to keep track of Wix site members' activity relevant for your app, i.e., comments count, followers count, etc. 

The service allows to have public and private counters: 
 - Public counters can be read by anyone in a site
 - Private counters can only be accessed by the site member the counter belongs to.
