# About Contacts

The Contacts service manages Wix sites' contacts. 
A contact is someone relevant to the site's business â€“ either a site visitor who has performed a meaningful interaction within the site,
 or a person who was added manually.  
 
In a Wix site, the site owner and anyone they have added as a contributor can view and manage the site's contacts.


A contact can be created in the following ways:

 - A site visitor fills in a form with their communication details 
 - A site visitor signs up to the site
 - The site owner or a contributor enters the contact manually or using the import contacts feature


A contact has the following fields:
- `id` - Unique identifier associated with the contact (read-only)
- `first_name` - Contact's first name
- `last_name` - Contact's last name
- `emails` - Email address(es) associated with the contact
- `phones` - Phone number(s) associated with the contact
- `addresses` - Street address(es) associated with the contact
