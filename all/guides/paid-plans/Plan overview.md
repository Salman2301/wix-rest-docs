# Plan

## What is a Paid Plan?
The Plan API includes all the details of plans from Paid Plans and allows to manage paid plans definitions.

## What are the Paid Plan types?
* Free plan
* One-time Payment plans charge a single payment
* Recurring Payment plans charge payments that repeat in predefined intervals (ex. Week, Month, Year). These plans can be set to expire or continue indefinitely until the user cancels their subscription.

## When does a plan expire?
The site owner can determine how long the plan will be active from the date of purchase. The active period is established 
in the same intervals as the payment periods only (weeks, months, years). The site owner may also create plans that 
never expire, the plan continues indefinitely until the user cancels. This is true for both One-time and Recurring plans.
